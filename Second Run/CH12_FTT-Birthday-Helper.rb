# Write a program to read in names and birthdates from a text file. It should
# then ask you for a name. You type one in, and it tells you when that person's
# next birthday will be (and, for the truly adventurous, how old they will be).
# The input file should look something like this:

# first_name last_name, month day,year

#hint: Use a hash
