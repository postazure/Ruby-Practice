puts "Hello there, and what\'s your name?"
name = gets.chomp

puts "Your name is " + name + "? What a lovely name!"
puts "Pleased to meet you, " + name + ". :)"


# "gets" will get all the letters, numbers, etc. 
# and the carrage return (ENTER)

#"gets.chomp" removes the ENTER but not
#all the whitespace (ie. spaces)
